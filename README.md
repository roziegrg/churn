# Customer Churn Analysis (EDA)

##  Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a customer churn dataset to
understand why customers stop using a service. The analysis focuses on identifying
patterns, trends, and key factors that influence customer churn using Python.

This project is part of my learning journey in **Data Analysis and Machine Learning**.
